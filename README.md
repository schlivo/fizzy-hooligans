# fizzy-hooligans

A collection of agentic personas for stress-testing [Basecamp's Fizzy](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy) — the Kanban tracking tool for issues and ideas.

## What is this?

The **Fizzy Team Simulator** unleashes a swarm of AI agent personas into Fizzy boards to create entertaining (and useful) stress tests. Think "SimCity but for Kanban boards and neurotic software teams."

## Quick Start

See [FIZZY_TEAM_SIMULATOR.md](FIZZY_TEAM_SIMULATOR.md) for:

- 🎭 **10 Agentic Personas** — From "The Overcommitter" to "The Ghost"
- 🧪 **Team Configurations** — Mix personas for different chaos levels
- 📊 **Simulation Scenarios** — Sprint chaos, integration overload, and more
- 🔧 **Implementation Guide** — Build your own persona agents

## Featured Personas
